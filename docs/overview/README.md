# Construction Site-Selection Platform — Harvard Multiland Homes
Goal: Rank Philippine cities for site selection with a transparent, explainable dashboard.

Anchor year: 2024 (time alignment is critical; projections start next)  
Geography: NCR, Region III, Region IV-A — PSGC aligned (Region ▸ Province ▸ City)  
Pillars: Demand (Single+Duplex), Income (per HH), GRDP per capita, LFS (2024 monthlies so far), Risk (fault/flood/landslide/storm surge/earthquakes)

Method (current phase):  
- Align names to PSGC, standardize schemas, and consolidate clean files.  
- No extrapolation yet; 2024 alignment via growth to follow.

Primary output (soon): `fact_table_clean_2024.csv` (after we project to 2024)
